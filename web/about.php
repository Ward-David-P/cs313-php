    <h1>About Me and Stuff</h1>
    <div class="info col-sm-4" id="aboutDiv">
        <p>My name is David Ward. I am from Mesa, Arizona USA. I served in the Ohio Cleveland Mission. I am studying
            Software Engineering and would like to develop educational software and tools. Currently, I work as a
            Solutions Engineer for GoDaddy. I love to do things outdoors. Hiking, backpacking, climbing, and camping
            are just a few of my hobbies. Right now I am really into bouldering. I enjoy eating many things, mostly
            stuff that isn't good for you. I especially love it when I can do these things with my wife, son (6), and
            daughter (3). I also enjoy reading comic books/graphic novels (particularly DC), video games, movies/TV,
            and reading.</p>
